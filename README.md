# homelab

This repository contains the configuration for my homelab. It is used for deploying various applications and services 
to my Kubernetes clusters. These applications are either developed by myself, or are open source projects that I find
interesting. They are either used for testing new technologies, or for personal use. 

### Components (wip)
- **kubernetes**: for container orchestration
- **gitlab**: for version control and CI/CD
- **helm**: for deploying applications
- **flux**: for GitOps
- **traefik**: for ingress
- **postgres**: for databases
- **redis**: for caching
- **prometheus**: for monitoring
- **grafana**: for visualization
- **open-telemetry**: for tracing
- **renovate**: for dependency updates
- **spring boot**: for backend services

### Principles
- ****Infrastructure as Code**: Manage and provision infrastructure through code to ensure consistency and repeatability.
- **Version Control**: Use Git for version control to track changes and collaborate effectively.
- **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks to reduce manual effort and minimize errors.
- **Scalability**: Design systems to scale horizontally and vertically to handle increased load.
- **Security**: Implement security best practices, including regular updates, access controls, and encryption.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Continuously monitor systems and maintain logs to detect and troubleshoot issues promptly.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Regularly back up data and have a recovery plan in place to prevent data loss.
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation for all components and processes.
- **Testing**: Implement thorough testing at all stages to ensure reliability and performance.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Use CI/CD pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
